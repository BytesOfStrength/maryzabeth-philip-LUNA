        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
          I am a passionate and dedicated aspiring software developer currently
          enrolled in Code the Dream, where I am building a strong foundation in
          essential front-end development technologies such as Javascript, HTML,
          and CSS. My drive for self-enrichment extends beyond coding; I have
          also earned a Meta Social Media Marketing Professional Certificate
          online which has improved my skills in digital communication and
          strategic thinking. My goal is to not only understand technical
          concepts, but also to apply them to create meaningful solutions,
          applying both my technical abilities and creative insights to build
          effective and engaging user experiences. Beyond my technical pursuits,
          I am deeply committed to contributing to the underserved needs of my
          surrounding community. I have previously organized and managed service
          projects by partnering with a local high school or other organizations
          that are also interested in assisting people who are facing
          difficulties. I aspire to find a career that can allow me to balance
          my professional goals with my passion for helping others, continuing
          to make a positive impact in the community.
